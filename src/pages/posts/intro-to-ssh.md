If you're one of many software developers that have come across "ssh into a server" and have no idea what that means, then this post is for you. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible so that anybody can read this and get a little grasp about what SSH means. I'll like to state that if you're looking for a deep cover of SSH then this post isn't for you.

What is SSH?

SSH stands for Secure Shell (Protocol).
