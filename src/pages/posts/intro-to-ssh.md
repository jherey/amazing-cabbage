If you're one of many software developers that have come across "ssh into a server" and have no idea what that means, then this post is for you. I think other people have this experience, I'll be reading a tutorial or watching a series and the tutor just asks you to SSH into your remote server and I'm like "what does that even mean?", you'll be absolutely correct if you guessed that was the end of the tutorial for me. 

This tutorial will try to explain what it means and why you should use it. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible so that anybody can read this and get a little grasp about what SSH means. I'll like to state that if you're looking for a deep explanation of SSH, then this post isn't for you. 

## What is SSH?

SSH stands for Secure Shell (Protocol). It's a method to achieve secure login from one computer to another (server) over an unsecured network. It enables network administrators or developers to execute shell commands on their server directly from your local computer.

## How to get your SSH Key?

## Basic SSH Commands

In conclusion, this is just the basics as SSH is so much deeper than the explanation I've given here, I've tried to keep it as basic as possible. I'll advise you search online to further your understanding and learn how it works under the hood, algorithm used, etc. I know many of you are anxious saying "Jerry enough of the sermon, I want to get my hands dirty". I'm begging for some patience as it'll all come together when I walk you through deploying a Node.js server and "sshing" into a Digital Ocean droplet.
