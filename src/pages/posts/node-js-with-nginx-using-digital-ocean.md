In this tutorial, I'll be walking you through how to deploy a Node.js app to Digital Ocean, using Nginx as a reverse proxy and add SSL certificates for security.

For this tutorial, we'll be deploying a very simple Node.js project. Here is a [link](https://github.com/jherey/basic_node_project) to the project.

1. If you don't have a Digital Ocean account, simply go to [digitalocean.com](digitalocean.com) or use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/fdf6b4e6a1b9)  to create an account.
2. Proceed to create a droplet. A droplet in Digital Ocean is just a server. I'll be using a Ubuntu server.
